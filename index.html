		<p> I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. I worked under the 
			guidance of <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/aaysu/">Dr. Aydin Aysu</a> at <a href="https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aaysu/">Hector Lab</a> and <a href="https://ncsu-wong.org/">Dr. Chau-Wai Wong</a>.
		<p> My research primarily focusses on enhancing the security and privacy of machine learning, with special emphasis on developing light-weight private-yet-efficient solution for edge devices.
		<p> I developed an approximate variational solution for user privacy against gradient inversion-based attacks.
